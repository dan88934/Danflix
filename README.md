Danflix README


**Description:**

Danflix is a clone of Netflix.

The frontend of the application is written in React JS. I followed this tutorial to create the front end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_EEwGe-a9o&t=17239s
This tutorial also involved setting up client-side routing with React Router.

After finishing the tutorial, I compiled the React code using Webpack. I then went on to create a backend server with Golang, utilizing 
the Gin web framework. I used a catch-all solution to handle the routing, directing all the relevant routes to index.html.
